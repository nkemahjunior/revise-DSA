/**
 * Given a sorted array, rearrange the array in such a way that the first position will have the largest number, the second position will have the
 * smallest, the third will have the second largest, and so on. using O(1) extra space.
 *
 * @Example  input = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}... output = [7, 1, 6, 2, 5, 3, 4]
 *
 * HINTS: - if you look at that output array, you will see that the max numbers are placed at even indexes while the min numbers are placed at odd indexes
 *        - we will use three pointers, one at the start of the array , one at the end of the array and they will both be moving forward and backward respectively
 *        - then we will have another pointer to traverse the array
