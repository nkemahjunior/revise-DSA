# What is a Trie

- Trie basically comes from the word Re**trie**val
- The main purpose of this data structure is to retrieve stored information very fast
-  the root of the trie is always empty

### Example : A trie with four words :
1. dog
2. dust
3. hat
4. home

````
                                    root -->      ()
                                            /           \
                                         (d)              (h)
                                        /   \            /    \  
                                     (o)     (u)      (a)       (o)
                                      |       |        |          |
                                     (g)     (s)      (t)        (m)
                                              |                   |
                                             (t)                 (e)

# Applications of the Trie data structure
- autocomplete. e.g when you are searching on Google and they suggest words similar to the one you are typing
- search contacts in phone: when you start typing they suggest names
- spell checking
