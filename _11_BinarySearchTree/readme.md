it is a type of binary tree in which data is organised in an ordered manner which helps in faster
search and insertion of data. it satisfies the following properties :
1) the left subtree of a node contains only nodes with values lesser than the node's value
2) the right subtree of a node contains only nodes with values greater than the node's value
3) the left and right subtree each must also be a binary search
